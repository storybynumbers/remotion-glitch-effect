# Remotion Effects

Local Remotion workspace for building and testing modular effects.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the Remotion preview:

   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

## Notes

- Place test media in `public/` to use it with `staticFile()`.
- The main entry is `src/index.tsx` with compositions defined in `src/Root.tsx`.
